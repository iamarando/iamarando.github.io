				<p>Lamija Čehajić (b.1997, Bosniak) is a young <br>aspiring artist who is interested in both <br>performance and object-oriented art, searching <br>for ways to merge them into a coherent whole. <br>as she was born in Prague but had to move to <br>Sarajevo as a child, her practice is informed <br>by a sense of displacement or lack, by a lack <br>of grounding and a confusion between <br>traditional Bosnia rooted values and her own <br>needs. <br>after graduating high school, she is currently <br>enrolled in Prague College at the department of <br>Fine Art, in a wide programme that encompasses <br>both traditional and new media, with an <br>emphasis on a strong conceptual and theoretical <br>backbone. she is trying to bend the digital to <br>communicate subtle concepts and gentle <br>aesthetics that she is inclined towards. she is <br>exploring the further fragmentation of the <br>narrative in the 21st century, loss of <br>continuity and linearity, using various media <br>that correlate to these themes. <br>recently, Lamija has participated in <br>alternative theatre projects in collaboration </p>
