				glass, spelt<br><br><br>


				for the assignment that proposed a hypothetical <br>sculpture for the outer space that would be <br>propelled into the universe, i decided to work <br>with the theme of a  potential human and <br>terrestrial message out there. my aim was to <br>condense the history of the human civilisations <br>into one object, while simultaneously referring <br>to the biosphere of the planet.<br><br>
 
				there the occurrence of the agricultural <br>revolution arose — as the milestone in known <br>history that marks the acceleration of human <br>development in the civilisational sense and the <br>first step into the profound changes that the <br>human species would cause in the environment. <br>therefore, each of the bubbles, made out of <br>glass, coming from the sand of the earth is <br>protecting a single grain of spelt — the <br></p>
