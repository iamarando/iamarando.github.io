				<p>i believe that most of my work behaves as <br>a visual poem.<br><br>it is trying to find the balance between the <br>domain of language and beyond which cannot be <br>articulated, visualising a metaphor that finds <br>its root in a concept that had been defined as <br>a thought yet originated initially from a <br>deeply felt inclination of the self.<br><br>dealing with the memory and the fragmentation <br>of narrative, it wishes to embody a sense of <br>identity, referring to the ideas about the <br>placement of the self within the historical <br>and social framework, as eternally suspended <br>between the future and the past. it evokes the <br>topics of displacement and the necessity of <br>adjustment in the midst of migration, <br>translating its longing for a safe space and <br>a sense of belonging into a generalised media <br>nostalgia. it searches for the authentic and <br>the warmly human, afraid of the alienating <br>world of spectacle and the abundance of <br>digitalised simulacra of contemporary culture.</p>

				<p>recently, i have discovered that the process of <br>artistic research, as a curiosity-driven <br>knowledge pursuit, provides a platform of <br>exploration that balances between the objective <br>and the subjective which forms a substantial <br>foundation for the creation of an artwork. <br>in the future, i would like to further <br>investigate the differentiation between <br>established objects of knowledge on one side, <br>and art as another medium of communication and <br>transmission of felt knowledge on the other. <br>the current questions that have arisen tackle <br>the issues of institutionalisation and the <br>established power structure, and the concepts <br>of ecological space and the possibility <br>of symbiotic coexistence.</p>
